SPCOM
=====

A universal SharePoint navigation tool written in JavaScript.

SUMMARY
The concept is simple, you go to a SharePoint site in your browser.  Click a 
bookmark that injects JavaScript on the page.  The script creates a poup that 
loads and displays information about the site as well as links to commonly needed
areas.

DETAILS
This tool was written initially to help simply navigate any SharePoint 
site on the fly without needing to install any software.  It has turned
into a tool not just for navigation but for displaying information useful
for SharePoint development.

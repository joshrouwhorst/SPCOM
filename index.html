        Go to any sharepoint site and click the bookmark to get the toolbar to pop up.  To close it, just click the bookmark again.
    </p>
    <p>
        The toolbar will grab any pages on the site that are in a Document Library and add them under Nav.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you click on the arrow next to the name of a List, Document Library, or Survey it will take you to its default view.  <br />
        Or you can click the name and it will give you more information.  You can click the name of the List on this pop up and go to the list settings.  <br />
        Most stuff in this area doesn't work yet but it's coming soon.
